### Community Decision Mechanism: Liquid Feedback

g0v embraces distributed processing, which makes things rarely necessary to be decided jointly. If discussion is needed, Liquid Feedback will be used to discuss, examine, and vote on such matters. Every g0v contributor has the right to examine and vote. (Participate any project, and be recommended by the project initiator will become a contributor.) Sign in with [Liquid Feedback](http://lqfb-test.g0v.tw/pf/).

### The Tendencies in Discussion
(adapted from COSCUP rookie guide)

* Buddies are humble, the team is joyful, and things are done passionately, so please maintain the spirit.
* Even though passionate, but also professional, please prepare yourself upfront and speak on good grounds.
* Even though joyful, please be moderated on stream chat.
* Even though humble, you don't have to lower yourself to be a 12 grade kid for textspeak or full of wrong words.
* The team prefer constructive feedbacks and execution over negative criticism. Be focused on relevant issues, and not criticize people.
* Be friendly to newbies, don't just tell them to RTFM ("Read The Fucking Manual") or STFG ("Search The Fucking Google").
